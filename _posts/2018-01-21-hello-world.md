### Gettin' Jiggy With It


I'm Geraldine and I would describe myself as _enigmatic_. My husband, Chris, would kindly suggest that _weird_ might be a more appropriate word choice but tough luck, _enigmatic_ has been a part of my email handle since I was 15, so that's what I am.


I was born and raised in Singapore -- a wonderful island city -- and as Chris would attest to it as the unofficial ambassador for the country, home to the best airport in the world and where food is nothing short of a mind-blowing revelation.


My two favourite words are: _serendipity_ and _sojourn_. As a former English and Literature teacher, it is hard to deny the attractiveness behind the sibilance created by the _s_ consonants and how that seems to be more evocative of meaning than the definitions themselves; two words that, on their own, carry slight hints of a contradiction, but when put together, create a new quality that highlights a soft sensuality derived from the temporality of things which people are constantly working towards -- happiness and a journey.


Like I said, _enigmatic_.


Why am I sharing this space then? The past couple of years have been life-altering in more ways than one and along the way, I have discovered so much about myself, my passions and just a tad more about the world around me. I hope that this space becomes a reflection of who I am, the things I do and the places I see.


What does the title of the greatest Will Smith hit song ever sung have to do with any of this? Truthfully, nothing. I just really like the song and I hope that as I embark on this new adventure, and you with me, we will always choose to bop to the beat and get jiggy with it (trackie bottoms and white tank top are optional).


xo,

G
